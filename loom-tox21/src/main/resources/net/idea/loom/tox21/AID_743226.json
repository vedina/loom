            "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are lipid-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily with three distinct subtypes namely PPAR alpha, PPAR delta (PPARd) and PPAR gamma. All these subtypes heterodimerizes with Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and have different physiological functions. Although the function of PPAR delta, is less well known until recently, but the identification of the subtype specific synthetic ligands and the creation of animal models revealed its role in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. To identify the compounds that inhibit PPAR-delta signaling, GeneBLAzer PPAR delta UAS-bla HEK293H cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) was used to screen the Tox21 compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the PPARd-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
