            "Androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays a critical role in AR-dependent prostate cancer and other androgen related diseases. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like AR may cause disruption of normal endocrine function as well as interfere with metabolic homeostasis, reproduction, developmental and behavioral functions. To identify the compounds that inhibit AR signaling, GeneBLAzer AR-UAS-bla-GripTite cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) stably integrated into HEK293 cells was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the AR-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."
